# gamma-camera

Geant4 simulation of a gamma camera.

## Short description

The aim of this simulation is to optimize the main parameters of a gamma camera in order to perform imaging with Ag-111. This simulation is built in the framework of the [ISOLPHARM project](https://isolpharm.pd.infn.it/web/).
